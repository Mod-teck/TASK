# 🚀 TASK: Enterprise-Grade AngularJS App — “Smart Logistics Platform”

## 🧭 **Project Overview:**
Create a **multi-tenant logistics management system** that handles:

- Shipping Companies
- Branches
- Drivers
- Shipment Tracking
- Payment Processing
- Real-time Alerts
- Detailed Reporting

---

## 🎯 **Main Objectives:**

### 1. 🧑‍💼 **Multi-Tenant Authentication System**
- Login with JWT or OAuth (using either an external API or a local one).
- Separate permissions for each tenant (shipping company).
- Support dynamic, changeable permissions (RBAC).
- Route guards and dynamic views based on user roles.

### 2. 📦 **Shipment Management**
- Full CRUD functionality for shipments.
- Shipments pass through stages (Pickup, Transit, Delivered, Failed).
- Track all changes with audit logs.
- Estimate delivery times.
- Support for heavy filtering and sorting operations.

### 3. 🚚 **Driver Management**
- Create and manage drivers.
- Track their locations (simulate random location updates every minute).
- Display active drivers on a map (Google Maps or OpenStreetMap Integration).

### 4. 💰 **Finance Module**
- Manage daily payment transactions.
- Generate financial reports per driver/branch/company.
- Export reports in PDF/Excel format.

### 5. 📊 **Reporting Dashboard**
- Real-time charts (Chart.js, D3.js).
- Advanced filtering options: by branch, time period, shipment status.
- Support for large datasets with pagination and lazy loading.

### 6. 🌐 **Multi-language Support (i18n)**
- Support for multiple languages (English + Arabic).
- Change language dynamically during runtime.
- Store translations locally and/or fetch from an API.

### 7. 🔔 **Real-time Notification System**
- Instant notifications via WebSocket or simulated polling.
- Each user gets personalized notifications.
- A notification center that allows filtering and viewing by date.

### 8. 📂 **File & Document Handling**
- Ability to attach PDFs or images to shipments.
- File preview before uploading.
- Access permissions based on user role.

### 9. 🧪 **Testing & Performance**
- Write unit tests for custom directives and services.
- Performance management:
  - Use of one-time binding `::`
  - Avoid excessive watchers
  - Virtual scrolling for efficient shipment listing

---

## 💡 **Key Required Skills:**
- Modular application architecture design.
- Lazy loading + Code splitting implementation.
- Building reusable components.
- Smart use of `$compile`, `$q`, and `$watchGroup`.
- Avoid using jQuery and use custom directives.
- Security-aware design for sensitive data handling.
- Clear strategy for future scaling and updates.

---

## 📁 **Bonus (Optional + Extra Points):**
- Offline Mode using IndexedDB + Service Workers.
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support.
- Theme switching.
- User activity tracking.
- Simple Workflow Editor (drag-and-drop like BPMN).
