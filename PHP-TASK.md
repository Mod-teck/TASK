# 🚀 Task: Advanced Laravel Application - "Integrated Task Management System with Role and Permission Support"

## 🧭 Project Description:
Create a **Task Management System** using **PHP** and **Laravel** with support for **roles and permissions**. The system will allow users to manage their daily tasks, assign tasks to teams, and track task progress. The system should support task creation, role customization, and time tracking for each task, along with notifications and alerts.

---

## 🎯 Main Objectives:

### 1. 📝 **Task Management**
- Develop a **task management system** that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks.
- Tasks should be **assigned to different users** based on their roles.
- Each task should have a **status** (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed", "Deferred") with **start and end dates**.
- Provide **alerts to users** when a task's status changes or when a deadline is approaching.

### 2. 👤 **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Implement a **role and permission system** where an **admin** can add and customize roles (e.g., "Admin", "User", "Manager").
- Each **role** has specific **permissions** such as managing tasks, adding users, and interacting with data.
- Integrate **authentication via JWT** or **OAuth 2.0** to secure access.

### 3. 🔔 **Real-time Notifications**
- Add **real-time notifications** to users using **Laravel Broadcast (WebSockets)** when a task changes or when the deadline is near.
- Support **email notifications** using **Laravel Mail** or integrate with services like **Mailgun**.

### 4. 📊 **Reports and Analytics**
- Provide **progress reports** for each user or team (e.g., completed tasks, in-progress tasks, deferred tasks).
- Support **interactive data visualization** using **Chart.js** or **Laravel Charts**.
- **Export reports** in multiple formats such as **PDF** or **Excel**.

### 5. 🧑‍💼 **User Management**
- Enable **user management** such as adding, editing, and deleting users.
- Support updating user personal information, such as password, profile picture, etc.
- Add advanced functionality for admins to enforce access restrictions and assign roles to users.

### 6. 🧪 **Testing**
- Write **unit tests** using **PHPUnit** to validate the core functionalities.
- Implement **integration tests** to test the interaction between system components.
- Perform **performance testing** to ensure the system can handle a large number of tasks and users.

### 7. ⚙️ **Performance Optimization**
- Optimize database queries using **Eloquent** and **Laravel Caching**.
- Use **Queues** to handle heavy tasks in the background, such as sending notifications or processing analytical reports.
- Implement **lazy loading** to load data only when needed.
