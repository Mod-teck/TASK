# HR Management System with Advanced Analytics Using Java

## Description:
The objective is to design and build an integrated **Human Resources Management System (HRMS)** using **Java**. The system should allow users to manage employees, track attendance and time, calculate salaries, and generate advanced analytical reports. The system must be scalable and handle edge cases professionally.

## Requirements:

### 1. Architecture:

#### Java Frameworks:
- **Spring Boot**: To build the server and create the API.
- **Spring Data JPA**: To interact with the database.
- **Spring Security**: To manage permissions and authentication (Authentication & Authorization).

#### Database:
- Design a flexible database using **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**.
- Use **Hibernate** to create entities and define relationships between them.
- Ensure query performance through the use of **Indexes** and **Stored Procedures**.

#### API Endpoints:
- All operations should be executed via an API following **RESTful** principles.
- Provide **API Documentation** using **Swagger** to describe how each endpoint functions.

### 2. Core Features:

#### Employee Management:
- Users should be able to add new employees with the following details:
  - Full name
  - Date of birth
  - Address
  - Phone number
  - Email
  - Department
  - Job title
  - Basic salary
- Users should be able to modify or delete employee information.
- Display a list of employees with details for each employee.

#### Attendance and Time Tracking:
- Register employee attendance using **Check-In/Check-Out** functionality.
- Store the date and time for each attendance record.
- Display the attendance history for each employee with total monthly hours worked.

#### Salary Calculation:
- Calculate the monthly salary for each employee based on:
  - Basic salary
  - Overtime hours
  - Deductions (e.g., absences or tardiness)
- Generate a **Payslip** that includes detailed income and deduction information.

#### Analytical Reports:
- Provide analytical reports on:
  - Attendance and absenteeism rates
  - Employee distribution by department
  - Average salary per department
- Display these reports using libraries such as **JFreeChart** or **Apache POI**.

### 3. Advanced Features:

#### Leave Management:
- Allow employees to request leave with specified types (Annual, Sick, etc.).
- Assign a department manager to approve leave requests.
- Display each employeeâ€™s leave history.

#### Real-Time Notifications:
- Send real-time notifications when:
  - A leave request is approved
  - Employee data is updated
- Use **WebSocket** to implement real-time notifications.

#### Search & Filter:
- Provide a powerful search engine to filter employees based on:
  - Department
  - Job title
  - Attendance status (Present/Absent)

#### Pagination & Caching:
- Implement **Pagination** to split results into pages.
- Use **Ehcache** to cache frequently accessed data, such as search results or commonly accessed employee records.

#### Background Jobs:
- Perform heavy tasks in the background using **Quartz Scheduler**.
  - Examples include:
    - Sending email notifications to employees when salaries are updated.
    - Automatically generating monthly reports.

### 4. Security:

#### Input Validation:
- Use **Hibernate Validator** to validate user input.
- Ensure protection against vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection** and **XSS**.

#### Rate Limiting:
- Implement **Spring Boot Rate Limiter** to restrict the number of requests from the same user within a specific time period.

#### Error Handling:
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.
- Log errors into files using **Log4j**.
