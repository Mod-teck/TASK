# 🚀 TASK: Advanced Java Spring Application — "IoT-Driven Smart Network Management and Security System"

## 🧭 **Project Description:**
Build a **Smart Network Management System** using **Java Spring** and **Spring Boot** that integrates **IoT devices** to manage the network, analyze performance, and provide **advanced security**. The system will be used to manage a set of connected devices on the network and analyze **real-time data** to detect **security threats** and improve **network management**.

## 🎯 **Main Objectives:**

### 1. 🌐 **IoT Device Management**
- Build a system for managing **IoT devices** where users can add, configure, and manage the connected devices.
- Support **automatic device discovery** and classification based on types (e.g., cameras, sensors, analyzers).
- Use **MQTT** or **CoAP** for device communication with the system.
- Support **remote device control** using **Spring WebFlux** for real-time updates.

### 2. 🔒 **Advanced Security**
- Secure the system using **OAuth 2.0** and **JWT** for authentication.
- **End-to-end encryption** of data between devices and the system using **AES** and **RSA**.
- Use **Spring Security** with **Access Control Lists (ACL)** to control access to devices based on roles.
- Integrate **biometric authentication** for accessing sensitive devices.

### 3. 📊 **Real-time Data Analytics**
- Use **Spring WebSockets** to deliver real-time data from connected devices.
- Integrate **Apache Kafka** or **Apache Pulsar** to process device data in real-time and analyze big data.
- Integrate **Apache Spark** to analyze data collected from devices and provide accurate predictions.
- Provide visual reports using **Chart.js** or **D3.js** for interactive data analysis.

### 4. 🏎️ **Performance Optimization**
- Use **Spring Cache** and **Redis** for caching repeated data and improving performance.
- Implement **code splitting** and **lazy loading** to optimize application loading times.
- Improve system response with **WebSockets** for enhanced real-time performance.
- Manage large data loads using **Web Workers** for intensive computational tasks in the background.

### 5. 🛠️ **Smart Network Management**
- Integrate **SDN (Software Defined Networking)** to manage the smart network through the system.
- Monitor network performance and detect failures using **Spring Boot Actuator**.
- Provide **real-time alerts** via **Spring WebSocket** in case of any network issues (e.g., low speed, lost connections).
- Use **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** to collect network data from devices.

### 6. 📡 **IoT Integration**
- Integrate **IoT Gateway** to convert data from smart devices to the system.
- Apply **Edge Computing** to analyze local data before sending it to the central system.
- Support protocols like **MQTT** and **CoAP** to connect devices and exchange data.
- Manage historical data and store it in **InfluxDB** or **TimescaleDB** for future analysis.

### 7. 📦 **External System Integration**
- Integrate the system with external systems like **CCTV monitoring** and **intruder alarm systems**.
- Support importing and exporting device data in multiple formats like **CSV** and **JSON**.
- Use **RESTful API** for data exchange with other applications or external services.

### 8. 🧪 **Testing**
- Write **Unit Tests** and **Integration Tests** using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**.
- Test system performance using **JMeter** or **Gatling**.
- Use **Selenium** to test the UI of the web application.
- Integrate **device compatibility testing** to ensure proper device interaction with the system.

### 9. 📦 **Cloud Deployment**
- Deploy the system using **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for scalability and flexibility.
- Deploy the system in cloud environments like **AWS** or **Azure**.
- Manage connected devices via **Cloud IoT Core** (e.g., AWS IoT Core or Google Cloud IoT Core).

### 10. 🔄 **Process Management**
- Integrate **Camunda BPM** or **Activiti** to manage processes and workflow analysis within the system.
- Enable users to customize and modify workflows using a **drag-and-drop interface**.
