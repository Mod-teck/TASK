# Multi-user Content Management System with Analytics

## Description:
The task is to design and build an advanced **Content Management System (CMS)** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. The system should allow users to create and manage content (articles, images, videos), with the capability to analyze user behavior and track performance. The system must be scalable and handle edge cases professionally.

---

## Requirements:

### 1. Backend:

#### **Node.js & Express.js:**
- Build a server using **Express.js**.
- Implement a **Modular Architecture** to separate the code into independent modules (such as routes, controllers, services, and models).
- Use **Middleware** to handle requests, including authentication and authorization checks.

#### **MongoDB:**
- Design a flexible database using **MongoDB**.
- Use **Mongoose** to create models and define relationships between them.
- Ensure query performance through the use of **Indexes** and **Aggregations**.

#### **API Endpoints:**
- All operations should be executed via an API using **RESTful** or **GraphQL**.
- Provide **API Documentation** using **Swagger** to explain how each endpoint works.

---

### 2. Core Features:

#### **Content Management:**
- Users should be able to create new content (articles, images, videos).
  - Articles should contain a title, content, tags, and an image.
  - Images should include an image file and a textual description.
  - Videos should contain a YouTube/Vimeo link and a textual description.
- Users should be able to edit or delete their created content.
- Display a list of all content with details such as:
  - Title, type, creation date, and view count.

#### **User Management:**
- Implement login and registration using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication.
- Users should be divided into the following roles:
  - **Admin**: Full system control.
  - **Editor**: Can create and edit content.
  - **Viewer**: Can only view content.
- Ensure proper **Authorization** for each operation based on the user role.

#### **User Analytics:**
- Track user behavior, including:
  - View count for each piece of content.
  - Time spent by users on content.
  - Device type (Mobile/Desktop).
- Provide an **Analytics Report** displaying this data visually using a library like **Chart.js**.

#### **Comment System:**
- Allow users to add comments on content.
- Support **nested comments** (Replies to comments).
- Provide an API to retrieve comments in a **tree structure**.

---

### 3. Advanced Features:

#### **File Uploads:**
- Allow users to upload images and videos.
- Use a library like **Multer** for handling file uploads.
- Store files in **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**.

#### **Real-Time Notifications:**
- Send real-time notifications when:
  - A new comment is added.
  - Content is updated.
- Use **Socket.io** to implement real-time notifications.

#### **Search & Filter:**
- Provide a powerful search engine using **Elasticsearch** or **MongoDB Full-Text Search**.
- Users should be able to search content by title, description, or tags.
- Filter content based on type (Article, Image, Video).

#### **Pagination & Caching:**
- Implement **Pagination** to divide results into pages.
- Use **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data, such as search results or commonly accessed content.

#### **Background Jobs:**
- Perform heavy tasks in the background using **Bull** or **Agenda**.
  - Examples include:
    - Sending emails to users when content is updated.
    - Analyzing user data and updating reports.

---

### 4. Security:

#### **Input Validation:**
- Use **Joi** or **Yup** for validating user input.
- Ensure protection against vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection** and **XSS**.

#### **Rate Limiting:**
- Implement **Express Rate Limit** to restrict the number of requests from the same user over a specified period.

#### **Error Handling:**
- Provide clear and user-friendly error messages.
- Log errors into files using **Winston**.

---

## Expected Outcome:
A fully functional CMS system that supports multiple users, is easy to use, secure, scalable, and includes detailed user behavior analytics.
